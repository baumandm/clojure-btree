## Introduction 

This is a Binary Search Tree implementation in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).  It was implemented as a learning experience and should not be used in production. 

## Installation

1. Install Leiningen and Clojure.  This project was developed and tested on Clojure 1.5.1.  I believe Leiningen will actually install the correct version of Clojure, which is specified in the [project.clj](https://github.com/baumandm/clojure-btree/blob/master/project.clj) file.

2. Download the code
    
        git clone git@github.com:baumandm/clojure-btree.git

3. Run the tests

        lein test
